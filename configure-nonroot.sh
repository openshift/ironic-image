# This script changes permissions to allow Ironic container to run as non-root
# user. As the same image is used to run ironic, ironic-httpd, ironic-dsnmasq,
# and ironic-log-watch via BMO's ironic k8s manifest, it has
# to be configured to work with multiple different users and groups, while they
# share files via bind mounts (/shared, /certs/*), which can only get one
# group id as "fsGroup". Additionally, dnsmasq needs three capabilities to run
# which we provide via "setcap", and "allowPrivilegeEscalation: true" in
# manifest.
