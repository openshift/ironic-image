Metal3 Ironic Container
=======================

This repo contains the files needed to build the Ironic images used by Metal3.

## Description

When updated, builds are automatically triggered on
<https://quay.io/repository/metal3-io/ironic/>

This repo supports the creation of multiple containers needed when provisioning
baremetal nodes with Ironic. Eventually there will be separate images for each
container, but currently separate containers can share this same image with
specific entry points.

The following entry points are provided:

- `runironic` - Starts the ironic-conductor and ironic-api processes to manage
   the provisioning of baremetal nodes.  Details on Ironic can be found at
   <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/>.  This is the default entry point
   used by the Dockerfile.
- `rundnsmasq` - Runs the dnmasq dhcp server to provide addresses and initiate
   PXE boot of baremetal nodes.  This includes a lightweight TFTP server.
   Details on dnsmasq can be found at
   <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html>.
- `runhttpd` - Starts the Apache web server to provide images via http for PXE
   boot and for deployment of the final images.
- `runlogwatch` - Waits for host provisioning ramdisk logs to appear, prints
   their contents and deletes files.

All of the containers must share a common mount point or data store.  Ironic
requires files for both the TFTP server and HTTP server to be stored in the same
partition.  This common store must include, in `<shared store>/html/images`,
the following images:

- ironic-python-agent.kernel
- ironic-python-agent.initramfs
- final image to be deployed onto node in qcow2 format

The following environment variables can be passed in to customize run-time
functionality:

- `PROVISIONING_MACS` - a comma seperated list of mac address of the master
   nodes (used to determine the `PROVISIONING_INTERFACE`)
- `PROVISIONING_INTERFACE` - interface to use for ironic, dnsmasq(dhcpd) and
   httpd (default provisioning, this is calculated if the above
   `PROVISIONING_MACS` is provided)
- `PROVISIONING_IP` - the specific IP to use (instead of calculating it based on
  the `PROVISIONING_INTERFACE`)
- `DNSMASQ_EXCEPT_INTERFACE` - interfaces to exclude when providing DHCP address
  (default `lo`)
- `HTTP_PORT` - port used by http server (default `80`)
- `HTTPD_SERVE_NODE_IMAGES` - used by runhttpd script, controls access
   to the `/shared/html/images` directory via the default virtual host
   `(HTTP_PORT)`.  (default `true`)
- `DHCP_RANGE` - dhcp range to use for provisioning (default
   `172.22.0.10-172.22.0.100`)
- `DHCP_HOSTS` - a `;` separated list of `dhcp-host` entries, e.g. known MAC
   addresses like `00:20:e0:3b:13:af;00:20:e0:3b:14:af` (empty by default). For
   more details on `dhcp-host` see
   [the man page](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html).
- `DHCP_IGNORE` - a set of tags on hosts that should be ignored and not allocate
   DHCP leases for, e.g. `tag:!known` to ignore any unknown hosts (empty by
   default)
- `MARIADB_PASSWORD` - The database password
- `OS_<section>_\_<name>=<value>` - This format can be used to set arbitary
   Ironic config options
- `IRONIC_RAMDISK_SSH_KEY` - A public key to allow ssh access to nodes running
   IPA, takes the format "ssh-rsa AAAAB3....."
- `IRONIC_KERNEL_PARAMS` - This parameter can be used to add additional kernel
   parameters to nodes running IPA
- `GATEWAY_IP` - gateway IP address to use for ironic dnsmasq(dhcpd)
- `DNS_IP` - DNS IP address to use for ironic dnsmasq(dhcpd)
- `IRONIC_IPA_COLLECTORS` - Use a custom set of collectors to be run on
   inspection. (default `default,logs`)
- `HTTPD_ENABLE_SENDFILE` - Whether to activate the EnableSendfile apache
   directive for httpd `(default, false)`
- `IRONIC_CONDUCTOR_HOST` - Host name of the current conductor (only makes
   sense to change for a multinode setup). Defaults to the IP address used
   for provisioning.
- `IRONIC_EXTERNAL_IP` - Optional external IP if Ironic is not accessible on
  `PROVISIONING_IP`.
- `IRONIC_EXTERNAL_CALLBACK_URL` - Override Ironic's external callback URL.
  Defaults to use `IRONIC_EXTERNAL_IP` if available.
- `IRONIC_EXTERNAL_HTTP_URL` - Override Ironic's external http URL. Defaults to
  use `IRONIC_EXTERNAL_IP` if available.
- `IRONIC_INSPECTOR_CALLBACK_ENDPOINT_OVERRIDE` - Override Inspector's callback
  URL. Defaults to use `IRONIC_EXTERNAL_IP` if available.

The ironic configuration can be overridden by various environment variables.
The following can serve as an example:

- `OS_CONDUCTOR__DEPLOY_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT=4800` - timeout (seconds) to wait for
   a callback from a deploy ramdisk
- `OS_CONDUCTOR__INSPECT_TIMEOUT=1800` - timeout (seconds) for waiting for node
   inspection
- `OS_CONDUCTOR__CLEAN_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT=1800` - timeout (seconds) to wait for a
   callback from the ramdisk doing the cleaning
- `OS_PXE__BOOT_RETRY_TIMEOUT=1200` - timeout (seconds) to enable boot retries.
